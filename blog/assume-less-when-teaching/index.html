    <div class="content">
      <p>I had an simple realisation while in a lecture the other day and I thought it interesting enough to share, despite it
being a simple idea. The observation is as follows: there is an inverse correspondence between the assumptions a lecturer
makes about what their student understands, and the speed and &lsquo;stability&rsquo; with which a student can learn new ideas.
Note this primarily applies to learning ideas that require understanding, not necessarily just memory.</p>

<p>A few clarifications up front. When I speak about what a student &lsquo;knows&rsquo;, I assume some depth of understanding, not
just a passing acquaintance with a topic, I am also primarily referring to what the student already knows, not what they
are in the process of learning. Speed refers to how quickly the student is able to absorb new information over
the course of a lecture or term, and &lsquo;stability&rsquo; refers to how likely they are to remember and maintain an understanding
of a topic after some time has passed. I also assume a single student as this makes the explanation simpler and the idea
can trivially be extended to a group of students.</p>

<p>Take the following three cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lecturer assumes the student knows less then they actually do</li>
<li>Lecturer assumes the student knows as much as they actually do</li>
<li>Lecturer assumes the student knows more then they actually do</li>
</ol>

<p>and the consequences of my claim</p>

<ol>
<li>The student learns slightly slower then their maximum learning pace, however acquires a very stable level of learning.</li>
<li>Maximum learning pace for student, however information is not particularly stable.</li>
<li>The student learns very little, consequently this is very very slow and very very unstable.</li>
</ol>

<p>Represented as a graph this looks as follows
